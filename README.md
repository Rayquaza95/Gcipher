# Gcipher
We decipher ciphers with gcipher. Particularly National Cipher Challenge Ciphers to decipher with gcipher

  Changes are made to the dev branch. We do this, and then when the feature (cipher) is added and the TRAVIS BUILD is true then we merge   with master and start again

# Ciphers:
  Caesar
  Mono-alphabetic Sub
  Rail-Fence
  Vigenere
